  abstract  = "Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable
               for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user
               experience on the device. For example, language models can
               improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can
               automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is
               often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may
               preclude logging to the data center and training there using
               conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves
               the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns
               a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term
               this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a
               practical method for the federated learning of deep networks
               based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive
               empirical evaluation, considering five different model
               architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate
               the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data
               distributions that are a defining characteristic of this
               setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and
               we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x
               as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.",
